# Seek-A-Job

Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. With Nbyula
growing exponentially, terraformers are looking forward to expanding
their team. Could you help them build a customizable job board?

I have developed this website as Assignment for Nbyula Recruitment Process.

Assignment Objective:
1. Terraformers and applicants should be able to sign up and login to the app
2. Terraformers should be able to post a job listing on a common job  board shared between other terraformers
3. The listing should contain: title, description (markdown
support is a plus), location, deadline, contact phone
number and contact email

4. Note that these job listings should be presented as cards on a board

5. Based upon how far the job listing is from the deadline, the cards should have a color. For simplicity, the listing which are due in more than 21 days should be green, less than 14 days should be yellow and less than 3 days should be red
6. Terraformers should be able to rearrange the cards on the board by drag and drop to help them modify the order in which theyâ€™re displayed to the applicants
7. Terraformers should be able to archive a job listing
8. Applicants should be able to mark their interest on any available and active job listing
9. Terraformers should be able to see interested applicants
